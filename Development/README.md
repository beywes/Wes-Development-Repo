# Development Projects

This directory is dedicated to learning and experimentation. It contains projects in various stages of development and serves as a sandbox for testing new technologies and concepts.

## Directory Structure

- `Docker/` - Docker learning projects and experiments
- `PowerShell/` - PowerShell scripting practice and automation experiments
- `Python/` - Python learning projects and code experiments
- `Terraform/` - Infrastructure as code learning and testing
- `CI-CD/` - CI/CD pipeline experiments and learning

## Development Guidelines

1. Each project should have its own directory with a descriptive name
2. Include a README.md in each project directory explaining:
   - Project purpose
   - Technologies used
   - Setup instructions
   - Learning objectives
3. Use version control for all projects
4. Document lessons learned and challenges faced
5. Keep security credentials out of source control

## Learning Path

Track your progress and learning objectives for each technology:

### Current Focus
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Python web development
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- [ ] PowerShell automation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline implementation

### Next Steps
1. Set up local CI/CD pipeline
2. Learn container orchestration
3. Implement infrastructure as code
4. Automate deployment processes
