This directory contains the configuration and setup for a local CI/CD pipeline that will be used for learning and testing purposes.

## Pipeline Components

1. **Version Control**
   - Git for source control
   - GitHub for repository hosting

2. **Code Quality**
   - Linting tools for each language
   - Unit testing frameworks
   - Code coverage tools

3. **Build Process**
   - Docker image building
   - Artifact creation
   - Dependency management

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests

5. **Deployment**
   - Local deployment scripts
   - Container orchestration
   - Infrastructure as code

## Tools to be Implemented

- [ ] Jenkins/GitHub Actions for pipeline automation
- [ ] SonarQube for code quality analysis
- [ ] Docker for containerization
- [ ] Terraform for infrastructure
- [ ] Ansible for configuration management
- [ ] Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
