## Imports and Dependencies

### Understanding Python Modules for Beginners

#### What is a Module?
Think of a module as a pre-written collection of code that you can use in your programs. It's like having a library of tools ready to use:

1. Real-World Analogy:
   - A kitchen is like your Python program
   - Kitchen tools (blender, mixer, etc.) are like modules
   - You don't build these tools; you just use them
   - Each tool has a specific purpose

2. Why Use Modules?
   - Don't reinvent the wheel
   - Save time by using tested, reliable code
   - Access powerful features easily
   - Keep your code organized

#### Types of Python Modules

1. Built-in Modules (Come with Python):
   ```python
   # Working with time
   import datetime    # Dates and times
   import time       # Time-related functions
   
   # Working with files and folders
   import os         # Operating system operations
   import shutil     # File operations
   
   # Working with data
   import json       # Handle JSON data
   import csv        # Handle CSV files
   
   # Math and numbers
   import math       # Mathematical operations
   import random     # Random number generation
   
   # Internet and web
   import urllib    # Web operations
   import email     # Email handling
   ```

2. Third-Party Modules (Need to install):
   ```python
   # Data analysis
   import pandas     # Data manipulation
   import numpy      # Numerical operations
   
   # Web development
   import flask      # Web applications
   import django     # Web framework
   
   # Graphics and games
   import pygame     # Game development
   import pillow     # Image processing
   ```

#### Installing Modules with pip

##### What is pip?
pip is Python's package installer - think of it as an "app store" for Python modules. It comes with Python and makes it easy to add new features to your programs.

##### Basic pip Usage
```bash
# Check if pip is installed
pip --version

# Install a module
pip install module_name

# Example: Installing a module for web development
pip install flask
```

##### Note About datetime
For our Task Manager app, we use the `datetime` module. Good news - it's part of Python's standard library, so we don't need to install it! That's why we can just use:
```python
from datetime import datetime
```

Some other useful built-in modules (no pip needed):
- `os`: Working with files and folders
- `json`: Handling JSON data
- `random`: Generate random numbers
- `time`: Basic time operations

#### Module Structure and Hierarchy

1. Module Organization:
   ```python
   module/
   ├── __init__.py          # Makes it a package
   ├── submodule1.py        # Component 1
   ├── submodule2.py        # Component 2
   └── data/                # Resources
       ├── config.json
       └── template.txt
   ```

2. Accessing Module Components:
   ```python
   # Different ways to access things in modules
   
   # 1. Direct import
   import datetime
   current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
   
   # 2. Specific import
   from datetime import datetime
   current_time = datetime.now()
   
   # 3. Submodule import
   from datetime.datetime import now()
   ```

### Our datetime Usage in Detail

Let's look at how we use datetime in our Task Manager:

```python
# 1. The import
from datetime import datetime

# 2. Using it in new_task
new_task = {
    'created_at': datetime.now(),  # Line 26!
}
```

Breaking down `datetime.now()`:

1. Module Hierarchy:
   ```
   datetime (module)
   └── datetime (class)
       └── now() (method)
   ```

2. What Each Part Does:
   - `datetime`: The class we imported
   - `now()`: A method that gets current date/time
   - Returns: `datetime` object with:
     * Year, Month, Day
     * Hour, Minute, Second
     * Microsecond
     * Timezone info

3. Why We Store It:
   ```python
   task['created_at'] = datetime.now()
   ```
   - Records exactly when task was created
   - Can be formatted for display
   - Can be used for sorting tasks
   - Can calculate task age

4. Common datetime Operations:
   ```python
   # Get current date and time
   now = datetime.now()
   
   # Format it nicely
   formatted = now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
   
   # Get specific parts
   year = now.year
   month = now.month
   day = now.day
   hour = now.hour
   
   # Create specific date
   christmas = datetime(2025, 12, 25)
   
   # Calculate time difference
   days_until = (christmas - now).days
   ```

### Popular Modules for Beginners

1. File Operations:
   ```python
   import os
   
   # List files in directory
   files = os.listdir('.')
   
   # Create directory
   os.mkdir('new_folder')
   ```

2. Random Numbers:
   ```python
   import random
   
   # Random number 1-100
   num = random.randint(1, 100)
   
   # Choose from list
   color = random.choice(['red', 'blue', 'green'])
   ```

3. Math Operations:
   ```python
   import math
   
   # Calculate square root
   root = math.sqrt(16)  # 4.0
   
   # Get π value
   pi = math.pi  # 3.141592...
   ```

4. JSON Handling:
   ```python
   import json
   
   # Save data
   data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
   json.dump(data, open('file.json', 'w'))
   
   # Load data
   loaded = json.load(open('file.json'))
   ```

## Common Questions About Modules

#### 1. "How do I know which module to use?"
Start by asking yourself:
- What am I trying to do?
- Is this a common programming task?
- What keywords describe my task?

Example Decision Process:
```python
# Task: "I want to work with dates"
# Keywords: dates, time, calendar
# Solution: datetime module

# Task: "I want to create random numbers"
# Keywords: random, numbers, choose
# Solution: random module

# Task: "I want to work with files"
# Keywords: files, folders, directory
# Solution: os module
```

#### 2. "What's the difference between import styles?"
```python
# Style 1: Import whole module
import datetime
datetime.datetime.now()    # More typing
                          # Very clear where now() comes from
                          # No name conflicts

# Style 2: Import specific class
from datetime import datetime
datetime.now()            # Less typing
                          # Still clear
                          # Possible name conflicts

# Style 3: Import everything (avoid this!)
from datetime import *
now()                     # Shortest typing
                          # Unclear where now() comes from
                          # High risk of name conflicts
```

#### 3. "How do modules work with Python files?"
```plaintext
my_project/
├── main.py           # Your main program
├── helper.py         # Your custom module
└── data/
    └── config.txt

# In helper.py
def useful_function():
    return "I help!"

# In main.py
import helper
result = helper.useful_function()
```

### Module Tips for Beginners

1. Start Small:
   - Begin with built-in modules
   - Learn one module at a time
   - Practice with simple examples

2. Use Help:
   ```python
   # Get help on a module
   help(datetime)
   
   # Get help on a specific function
   help(datetime.now)
   ```

3. Check Documentation:
   - Use official Python docs
   - Look for examples
   - Read about best practices

### Global Variables and Lists

Let's look at these important lines in our code:

```python
# Global variables (Lines 4-5)
tasks = []
PRIORITY_LEVELS = ['LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH']
```

#### What Are Global Variables?
Global variables are like shared storage boxes that any part of your program can access. Think of them as:
- Public bulletin boards where everyone can read and write
- Variables that live outside of any function
- Accessible from anywhere in your code

In our Task Manager:
```python
tasks = []  # Global list to store all tasks
```
- Any function can add, remove, or view tasks
- Changes to tasks are visible everywhere
- The list persists throughout the program's life

#### Understanding Lists
A list in Python is like a container that can hold multiple items:
```python
# Empty list (our tasks start empty)
tasks = []

# List with items
shopping = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

What makes lists special:
- Can hold any number of items
- Can mix different types of data
- Can be changed (add/remove items)
- Keep items in order
- Access items by their position (index)

In our Task Manager, each task will be added to the `tasks` list:
```python
# Example of how tasks list might look after adding items
tasks = [
    {'name': 'Learn Python', 'priority': 'HIGH', 'completed': False},
    {'name': 'Write Code', 'priority': 'MEDIUM', 'completed': True}
]
```

#### Constants and ALL CAPS
```python
PRIORITY_LEVELS = ['LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH']
```

Why ALL CAPS?
- It's a Python convention (like a coding tradition)
- Tells other programmers "don't change this value"
- Used for constants (values that shouldn't change)
- Makes important values stand out in the code

In our Task Manager:
- `PRIORITY_LEVELS` defines allowed priority values
- ALL CAPS tells us these priorities are fixed
- List makes it easy to:
  * Check if a priority is valid
  * Show available priorities to users
  * Maintain consistent priority levels

Example usage:
```python
# Check if priority is valid
if priority in PRIORITY_LEVELS:
    print("Valid priority!")

# Show available priorities
print("Available priorities:", PRIORITY_LEVELS)

# Get highest priority
highest_priority = PRIORITY_LEVELS[-1]  # 'HIGH'
```

#### Why Global Variables Here?
We use global variables in our Task Manager because:
1. `tasks` list:
   - Needs to persist between function calls
   - Must be accessible to all functions
   - Stores the central data of our application

2. `PRIORITY_LEVELS`:
   - Defines valid priorities throughout the app
   - Never changes during program execution
   - Used by multiple functions for validation

Best Practice Note:
While global variables are useful here, they should be used carefully:
- Limit global variables to essential shared data
- Use constants (like `PRIORITY_LEVELS`) when values shouldn't change
- Consider using classes for more complex applications

## Functions

#### The add_task Function (Lines 17-28)
```python
def add_task(title, priority='LOW'):
    """Creates a new task and adds it to our task list."""
    if priority not in PRIORITY_LEVELS:
        print(f"Error: Priority must be one of {PRIORITY_LEVELS}")
        return False
    
    new_task = {
        'title': title,
        'priority': priority,
        'created_at': datetime.now(),
        'completed': False
    }
```

Let's break down this function line by line:

1. Function Definition (Line 17):
   ```python
   def add_task(title, priority='LOW'):
   ```
   Let's break this down in order:
   
   First, the function declaration:
   - `def`: Tells Python we're creating a new function
     * Short for "define"
     * Like saying "I'm about to create a new tool"
     * All functions start with this keyword
   
   - `add_task`: Name of the function
     * Should be descriptive of what it does
     * Uses snake_case (underscores between words)
     * Good names help others understand your code
     * Example: `add_task` clearly shows it adds a task

   Now, understanding the parameters:
   - Parameters are like labeled boxes where you put information the function needs
   - They go inside the parentheses `(...)` after the function name
   - Each parameter is a variable that only exists inside the function
   
   In our function:
   - `title`: Required parameter
     * Must be provided when calling the function
     * No default value
     * Example: `add_task("Learn Python")`
   
   - `priority='LOW'`: Optional parameter
     * Has a default value of 'LOW'
     * Can be overridden when calling function
     * Example: `add_task("Fix bug", priority="HIGH")`

   How Parameters Work:
   ```python
   # When you call:
   add_task("Learn Python", priority="HIGH")
   
   # Inside function:
   title = "Learn Python"    # title parameter gets this value
   priority = "HIGH"         # priority parameter gets this value
   
   # Or when you call:
   add_task("Learn Python")  # Using default priority
   
   # Inside function:
   title = "Learn Python"    # title parameter gets this value
   priority = "LOW"         # priority uses default value
   ```

   Parameter Usage (Line 19):
   ```python
   if priority not in PRIORITY_LEVELS:
   ```
   - `priority` here is the same variable from the parameters
   - It contains whatever value was passed to the function
   - It can access `PRIORITY_LEVELS` because that's a global variable
   - Examples:
     ```python
     # Example 1:
     add_task("Task 1", priority="HIGH")
     # In Line 19: priority = "HIGH"
     # Checks if "HIGH" is in ['LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH']
     # Result: Valid! Continue with task creation
     
     # Example 2:
     add_task("Task 2", priority="URGENT")
     # In Line 19: priority = "URGENT"
     # Checks if "URGENT" is in ['LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH']
     # Result: Invalid! Show error and return False
     ```

2. Docstring (Line 18):
   ```python
   """Creates a new task and adds it to our task list."""
   ```
   - Triple quotes `"""` create a documentation string
   - Explains what the function does
   - Can be accessed using `help(add_task)`

3. Priority Validation (Lines 19-21):
   ```python
   if priority not in PRIORITY_LEVELS:
       print(f"Error: Priority must be one of {PRIORITY_LEVELS}")
       return False
   ```
   Let's break this down:

   - `if`: This is a conditional statement
     * Like asking a yes/no question
     * If the answer is "yes", run the code inside
     * If "no", skip this code block
   
   - `priority not in PRIORITY_LEVELS`:
     * `priority`: The value user provided (e.g., "HIGH", "LOW", etc.)
     * `not in`: Checks if something is missing from a list
     * `PRIORITY_LEVELS`: Our global list ['LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH']
     * Example: If user enters "URGENT", it's not in our list, so run the error code

   - `print(f"Error: ...")`:
     * `print`: Shows message to user
     * `f"..."`: Called an f-string (formatted string)
     * `{PRIORITY_LEVELS}`: Inside f-string, shows actual list values
     * Example output: "Error: Priority must be one of ['LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH']"

   - `return False`:
     * `return`: Exits the function immediately
     * `False`: Tells the program "task creation failed"
     * Like saying "Stop here, something went wrong"
     * Prevents creating task with invalid priority

   In human terms, this code is saying:
   > "Hey, let me check if this priority level makes sense. If it's not 'LOW', 'MEDIUM', or 'HIGH', 
   > I'll tell the user what the valid options are and stop here without creating the task. 
   > This way, we keep our task list clean and valid."

4. Task Creation (Lines 23-28):
   ```python
   new_task = {
       'title': title,
       'priority': priority,
       'created_at': datetime.now(),
       'completed': False
   }
   ```
   - Creates a dictionary (using `{}`)
   - Dictionary stores task details as key-value pairs:
     * `'title'`: The task name (from function parameter)
     * `'priority'`: Task importance (from function parameter)
     * `'created_at'`: Current time stamp
     * `'completed'`: Task status (starts as False)

#### How add_task Works

Example Usage:
```python
# Create a regular task
add_task("Learn Python")  # Uses default LOW priority

# Create an urgent task
add_task("Fix bug", priority="HIGH")

# Try invalid priority (will fail)
add_task("Test task", priority="SUPER")  # Error message
```

What Makes This Function Special:
1. Default Parameters:
   - `priority='LOW'` means you don't have to specify priority
   - Makes the function more flexible and user-friendly

2. Input Validation:
   - Checks priority before creating task
   - Prevents invalid data from entering our system
   - Provides helpful error message

3. Dictionary Usage:
   - Uses dictionary to organize task data
   - Each task property has a clear label
   - Easy to add new properties later

4. Time Tracking:
   - Automatically records creation time
   - Uses `datetime.now()` from our imported module

Best Practices Demonstrated:
- Input validation before processing
- Clear error messages
- Default values for optional parameters
- Automatic timestamp creation
- Clean data structure

Finally:
- The colon `:` at the end marks where the function definition ends
- Everything indented after this is part of the function
- Think of it like saying "here's what the function will do"
